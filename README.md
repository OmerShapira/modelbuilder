Modelbuilder
============

Geometry library for Processing focused on parametric modeling and digital fabrication, first released in 2011 as part of my artist-in-residence project with Makerbot Industries. 

The aim of the library is to simplify the construction and manipulation of parametrically generated mesh geometries. This is accomplished by providing object-oriented data structures and workflows (UVertexList to define edges, UGeometry to generate and modify polygon meshes) based on the beginShape() / endShape() logic used both by Processing and OpenGL. Processing 2.0 now has a PShape3D class, 

Modelbuilder was created to be easy to use even for mathematically challenged people like myself, the goal being to provide users with simplified means of creating parametric.3D models just using code while keeping the 

computational geometry can be . The UVec3 -> UVertexList -> UGeometry workflow takes care of a lot of the heavy-lifting involved in constructing 3D objects and was designed to 


Over the last year, Modelbuilder has also become a convenient platform for teaching, 

  trouble-solving Swiss Army Knife when teaching workshops, 

has also become a somewhat serious teaching tool, 

in particular the shorter [independent workshops](http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/workshops-in-new-york/) I teach in New York.
