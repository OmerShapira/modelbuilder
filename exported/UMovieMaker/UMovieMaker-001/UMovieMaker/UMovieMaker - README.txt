UMovieMaker is a replacement for Dan Shiffman's MovieMaker class,
which was discontinued for Processing 2.0 beta. It uses the Monte 
Media Library (http://www.randelshofer.ch/monte/) by Werner 
Randelshofer and can write Quicktime without being dependent on 
QTJava.zip. 

UMovieMaker currently only supports Quicktime PNG output, although the
Monte library is capable of writing AVI and other formats as well.
The library syntax is intentionally similar to MovieMaker, although it does  
not re-create all the functions of that library.
